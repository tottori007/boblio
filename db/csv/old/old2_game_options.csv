7866,10 DAYS IN THE USA,"You have 10 Days in the USA. Travel the country by jet, car, and on foot. Plan your trip from start to finish using destination and transportation tiles. With a little luck and clever planning, you just might outwit your fellow travelers.&#10;&#10;This is the first installment in the 10 Days in series.&#10;                       &#10;There are 50 state tiles, 10 colored airplane tiles, and 6 car tiles. Players all flip tiles one at a time, examine them, and put them in the 10 &quot;days&quot; of their tile tray, in any order. Then in turn, they draw a tile from one of three face-up piles or a face-down pile. The new tile may replace one tile in their tray, with that tile (or the unused drawn tile) discarded onto any of the face-up piles. Alternatively, players may swap any two tiles in their tray. When a player has all their days connected correctly, they win the game.&#10;&#10;Travel Connections:&#10;By Foot - bordering state tiles may be placed side-by-side&#10;By Automobile - states may be connected by driving through a third state which borders them both (the car tile is put between them)&#10;By Air - Two states of the same color may be connected by a same-color airplane placed between them&quot;&#10;&#10;",
217335,ラミー111,"The description of gameplay in 111 Ants &mdash; first released as MyRummy 111 &mdash; requires only one sentence: Take a hand of unsorted cards, draw either a face-down or face-up card on your turn and put it in the right place, then place another card to the left or right of it. Your goal is to be the first to sort your cards in ascending or descending order, which is both easy and challenging since the cards have different qualities. Unfortunately, valuable cards rarely sit in the right place...&#10;&#10;",
170430,クリスマスの12日,"12 Days of Christmas is a card game designed by Dr. Gord Hamilton for 3-8 players.&#10;&#10;To play, deal out twelve cards to each player; the deck consists of 78 cards: one 1, two 2s, and so on up to twelve 12s. By following the lead established by the first player, each player attempts to give away all of her cards before the other players can. The first player can lead a single card, a set of at least two cards of the same value, or a straight of at least two cards. The next players either pass or play a similar combination of cards (although not necessarily the same number of cards) that includes at least one card that's as low or lower than the lead player's low card. Whoever has played the lowest card once everyone has passed becomes the new lead player.&#10;&#10;Whoever runs out of cards first claims one of the available gift cards; whoever has the most cards left in hand must give a gift card to this round's winner! Whoever has the most gifts when the gifts run out wins.&#10;&#10;",

The first player to create their third complete row wins!&#10;&#10;",
207830,５ミニッツダンジョン,"5-&shy;Minute Dungeon is a chaotic, co-&shy;operative, real-&shy;time card game in which players have only five minutes to escape the randomized dungeon. Communication and teamwork are critical to survival because there's no time to form a carefully considered plan &mdash; and no predicting what dangers lie ahead.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players assume the role of one of ten heroes, each with special cards and abilities. Once the five-minute timer starts, the race is on to defeat all the monsters inside the dungeon. In order to defeat a monster, players must match symbols from their hand with ones on the monster's card. At the end of each dungeon is a powerful dungeon boss &mdash; and after the first boss is defeated, the campaign continues to the second boss. Each boss, and each randomized dungeon, gets harder until players reach the fifth and final boss.&#10;&#10;",
271512,,"5211 is a fast-playing card game with a unique scoring method that rewards clever play!&#10;&#10;This game has cards 1-6 in five colors. Each player starts with a hand of five cards. Players play two cards face-down, then simultaneously reveal them. They refill their hand, then repeat this process two more times, but only with one card.&#10;&#10;The cards of the majority color will score &mdash; unless too many are present, in which case the color busts and the second most color scores. In case of a tie for majority, the tied colors are also out. These rounds are repeated until the deck runs out. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;5211 is a new edition of 5 COLORS that has all new art.&#10;&#10;",
432,ニムト,"In 6 nimmt!, a.k.a. Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.&#10;&#10;",
68448,世界の七不思議,"You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how her choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;",
173346,世界の七不思議デュエル,"In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.&#10;&#10;What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;",

202976,世界の七不思議デュエル：パンテオン,"A pantheon from several civilizations &mdash; including Greek, Egyptian, and Middle-Eastern &mdash; gets added to 7 Wonders Duel in 7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon, with each god having its own power to help you or hinder your opponent.&#10;&#10;During Age I you collect mythology tokens &mdash; which allow you to choose which deities have a place in the Pantheon &mdash; and during Age II you collect offering tokens, which help you court those deities. Then, during Ages II and III, you can activate a god or goddess in the Pantheon instead of taking a card from the pyramid. To do so, you pay whatever that god or goddess demands from you in offerings, then place it next to your city.&#10;&#10;With Isis on your side, you can use a card from the discard pile to construct one of your Wonders for free. Zeus, whose nod determines what happens and what does not, enables you to discard any single card from the card structure that you want, as well as any mythology or offering token that may be on it. The Phoenician goddess Tanit, whose people were renowned for trade, fills your coffers with twelve pieces of gold. Enki, the Sumerian god of crafts, technology, and creation, lets you choose one of two progress tokens. Minerva's ability to stop the conflict pawn from moving toward you can assist with a military victory or save you from military defeat.&#10;&#10;What's more, instead of adding three guild cards to the deck for Age III, you add three of five Grand Temples. Each Grand Temple belongs to a different Mediterranean culture, and if you possess a mythology token from that culture, you can build the temple for free. These temples are worth a total of 5, 12, or 21 points, depending on how many you build.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon also includes two new Wonders: the Sanctuary (which gives you an additional turn and allows you to invoke deities at a reduced price) and the Divine Theater (which grants points and access to additional gods).&#10;&#10;",

In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!&#10;&#10;Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;In The Dungeon, the players awaken in a prison cell in the middle ages with no memory of how they got there. What happened? What strange things are taking place in this dungeon? And most importantly, how can they get out? Over three chapters, players will jointly explore rooms, combine objects, and perhaps even encounter creatures that lurk in the dark rooms of the old castle...&#10;&#10;",

There, the desperate remnants of society have learned that the energy of the very breaches the beings use to attack them can be repurposed through various gems, transforming the malign energies within into beneficial spells and weapons to aid their last line of defense: the breach mages.&#10;&#10;Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack, and deck management rules that require careful planning with every discarded card. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.&#10;&#10;",
155695,戦国時代,"Age of War is a quick-playing game of conquest. Fourteen cards are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one castle and the symbols required to conquer this castle, with the symbols separated into battle lines. Each castle belongs to a clan, with some clans having only a single castle and some having up to four castles.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show archery, cavalry, daimyo, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional daimyo line in the process. If a player owns all the castles of one clan, however, those castles are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these castles are now worth more points because you've united the clan under one ruler (you) and strengthened your hold over Japan.&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...&#10;&#10;",

So long plows and veggies!&#10;&#10;In Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small, you become an animal breeder of horses, cows, sheep and pigs and try to make the most of your pastures. Players start with a 3x2 game board that can be expanded during play to give more room for players to grow and animals to run free. Sixteen possible actions are available for players to take, with each player taking three actions total in each of the eight rounds.&#10;&#10;The player who amasses the most victory points through enclosing space with fences and acquiring the largest number and variety of animals and victory point-generating buildings will be the winner.&#10;&#10;Four Standard Buildings and 4 special buildings are available in the base game.  These buildings each provide unique special abilities during play and/or VP at game end.

The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.&#10;&#10;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex.

On a player's turn, he rolls the six-sided die. If the number on the die doesn't match the number of holes on any card in the row, the player peeks at one of these cards to see whether it shows cheese or a trap on the reverse side, then returns it to the row.

If the number on the die matches the number of holes on at least one card in the row, the player can either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take one of these cards, reveal it, and place it in front of himself, or&#10;    Take one of these cards and place it on the discard pile without revealing its opposite side to anyone.&#10;&#10;&#10;In either case, the player then fills the empty spot in the row with the top card from the deck.&#10;&#10;If someone collects a third trap, the game ends, this player automatically loses, and everyone else counts the number of holes on their cheese cards; trap cards are worth no points.

For example, while silver can be sold for a high price at the market, fish can be exchanged for other goods at the harbor and alpaca can produce wool at the farm that can then be made into cloth.&#10;&#10;Aside from building up an effective production, players must fulfill their orders at the right time, develop the road in good time and store their goods cleverly enough to fill their warehouses in the most valuable way.

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;The Revised Core Set for Android: Netrunner released in late 2017 includes cards from the original Core Set released in 2012 as well as cards from the Genesis Cycle and Spin Cycle series of Data Packs.

8229,ナゲッツ,"In Nuggets (2003), players try to surround the &quot;gold mines&quot; (numbered cylinders) on an 8x5 grid board. On a turn, a player either places a numbered tile face down or places two fence sections on the board; these fences determine the borders of each claim, and each claim must be at least four spaces large. At the end of the game, all tiles are revealed, and each gold mine is awarded to the player whose tiles in that claim have the largest sum, with ties resulting in an equal division of points. Whoever collects the most mine points wins.&#10;&#10;Armad&ouml;ra (2013) uses the same gameplay as Nuggets for the base game, albeit with the players themed as orcs, elves, mages and goblins on the hunt for dwarven gold. Armod&ouml;ra also adds advanced rules to the game, with each player receiving one reinforcement token and 1-2 special power tokens. Instead of placing a warrior or erecting palisades (fences), a player can place a reinforcement token on one of his warriors in a territory that's already filled, boosting the strength of that warrior by one. A player can use his special power before taking one of the three normal actions, with the elf shooting an opposing warrior in an unfilled territory (lowering his strength by one), the orc placing an additional palisade that turn, the goblin placing a second warrior (with this one being face-up), and the mage looking at the value of an already placed opponent's warrior.&#10;&#10;",

230802,アズール,"Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.&#10;&#10;In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace.

2397,バックギャモン,"Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&#10;&#10;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&#10;&#10;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.&#10;&#10;It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).&#10;&#10;The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.&#10;&#10;",

The tree trunk &mdash; which is the game container in many versions &mdash; is placed in the middle of the table with the lid on it. On a turn, a player announces that they'll play 1-3 cards, then they turn the cards over from their deck one by one, placing them on the tree as required by what's depicted on the card. If the card shows only foliage, then you can place it anywhere; if it shows a flower or monkey, then you must make the card hang over the edge so that the &quot;ground&quot; depicted on the card has no part of the tree underneath it. The snake must be placed between two other cards, the toucan tossed on top from a foot away, the leopard dropped straight onto the tree from a foot above, and the bat dropped onto the tree &mdash; but only after you close your eyes before extending your arm over the table! The beehive card can't be covered by anything except foliage and flowers, while the chameleon copies the card previously played.&#10;&#10;If any cards fall off the tree while you're adding something to it, then you place those cards (and any cards that you've yet to place that turn) in a personal penalty pile.

Players then each place three cities on the game board, with a knight in each city. They then take turns in clockwise order, with each player taking exactly one action from the six possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Recruitment: Add two knights to a city, or three knights if the city is adjacent to a lake.&#10;    Movement: Move one or two of your knights one space each. A knight can't enter a lake (blub), a mountain with an opposing pawn, or any space with an opponent's city or stronghold or two knights of the same opposing color. If you move a second knight into a space with an opposing pawn or village, remove those tokens and take one resource from the village owner.&#10;    Construction: Remove one or more of your knights from the game board and replace each with a village or stronghold, gaining one resource token matching the landscape under the structure.&#10;    New City: Replace one of your villages with a city and earn 10 victory points (VPs).&#10;    Expedition: Remove two knights from your reserve, placing one back in the box out of play and the other on any empty space on the edge of the game board.&#10;    Noble Title: Discard at least 15 resource points, then upgrade your title: baron to viscount, then count, marquis, and finally duke.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once any player has gained the title of duke, finish the round, then tally the VPs, with players scoring for resources still in their possession, their rank in the game, and the number of cities they built.

Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order.

As an analogy, try to explain a worker placement game, but without using any game words. As soon as you say 'meeple', or 'VPs', you've lost.&#10;&#10;The game uses a system similar to Insider. A player secretly identifies the hidden Katakana word from a deck. This player is the master, and tries to guide the others to identify the word.

11,ボーナンザ,"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.&#10;&#10;In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.&#10;&#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.&#10;&#10;",

Working with limited information, players must pool their wits and resources to dismantle live bombs. Dismantling is carried out by finding pairs of code tiles with the same number. Aim to clear the missions without blowing yourselves up. All players share the victory or suffer defeat together. Work as a team towards victory!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game consists of numbered cards, with four copies each of 1-12 and with stars and bombs having decimal numbers, e.g., 3.1 and 6.5. You receive a hand of cards and place them on a rack facing yourself in numerical order. Standing cards are &quot;armed&quot;, and as cards are disarmed, you lay them sideways and reveal them to others. Some information is revealed initially, and on your turn, you can attempt a pair disarm, a self disarm, or a bomb dismantling.&#10;&#10;For a pair disarm, point to a tile on another player's rack and declare what number or star it is. If you're correct and you have the matching item, both of them are disarmed. For a self disarm, you can reveal pairs of matching cards on your own rack if you know no other player has any. If all numbers and stars have been removed from your rack, you can then dismantle one bomb on your rack.)&#10;&#10;What's more, you and your fellow professional bomb disposal specialists can work through a sequence of fifty missions, which are listed in a separate scenario book. If you wish, you can also just pick and play specific missions that you like. You won't be able to complete everything in one sitting, so gather your friends and meet up over multiple play sessions. The missions start off easy, but steadily grow harder.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

Whoever manages to earn the greatest trust from the guardians and manages to brighten their city the most will win the game.&#10;&#10;The engine for Bonfire are the three-coloured tiles you will be puzzling onto your player board. When you manage to place the same colours adjacent to one another, you will receive more action tiles of that specific kind. This will allow you to specialize in certain types of actions and pursue different strategies. &#10;You can use the tiles to perform the following actions: &#10;- Move your ship to an island &#10;- Receive a task from an island by spending two resources &#10;- Invite a guardian of light into your city &#10;- Trigger a procession of guardians through your city and gain resources. &#10;- Add a landscape tile to your city (this is where the processions take place) &#10;- Recruit a gnome gaining a special ability or victory points &#10;- Find support by the last bonfire, gaining portals, resources or action tiles&#10;&#10;You will play in turn order until a fixed number of tasks has been solved, after which each player has 5 more turns. During final scoring, you will receive points for your completed tasks (the bonfires) and any improvements made there (portals, landscapes or guardians).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;",
619,ボトルインプ,"In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).&#10;&#10;Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.  Play continues until the point goal is reached.&#10;&#10;In the 2003 edition the complete story by R.L. Stevenson http://gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca/bottlimp.htm is included (in both English &amp; German) and the bottle is a nice wooden piece.  Earlier versions had a stand-up cardboard piece that you cut out.&#10;&#10;",

If you're playing with two two-player teams, each team gets four balls. If you're only playing with two players, each player gets eight balls. Flip over one of the pattern cards to see which pattern you need to create. The green cards are easier than the blue cards.

257726,ブリックス,"Brikks can be viewed as tabletop Tetris, with each player trying to place falling blocks into their grid to score the most points.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player draws a different quadromino at the bottom of their individual game sheet. On a turn, the active player rolls two dice &mdash; a colored d6 and a numbered d4 &mdash; then optionally rolls both dice again. The two dice determine which specific quadromino &mdash; that is, which colored shape and in which orientation &mdash; all players must &quot;drop&quot; into their grid. To represent this, you draw an outline of the block at the bottom of your sheet as if you had dropped it in from the top, then X out the spaces covered by the quadromino.&#10;&#10;If you cover a circle on the grid that's the same color as the quadromino just placed there, you collect two energy points. By spending one energy point on a turn, you can possibly &quot;rotate&quot; the quadromino to be placed depending on what dice were rolled; by spending five energy points, you can place exactly the quadromino you want, ignoring the result of the dice. As you collect energy, you might cover an X on the energy chart; if you do, you track these Xs on a separate &quot;extra point&quot; bar, with the points escalating for each X you collect. If you complete 2-4 lines through the placement of a single quadromino, you collect an additional 1-4 Xs for this extra point bar.&#10;&#10;Each player has three bombs they can spend to blow up a block instead of placing it, but by doing so you give up endgame points.&#10;&#10;As soon as you can no longer place a quadromino in your grid, your game is over. Once everyone has filled their grid to the top, tally your points. In addition to the extra points bar and any bombs unused, you score 1-5 points for each horizontal line that contains 8-10 Xs, with these line points doubling, or even quadrupling, as you go higher in the grid. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;&quot;Brikks&quot; also contains rules for a duel mode and a solitaire mode.&#10;&#10;",

What kind of &ldquo;advice for graduating seniors&rdquo; will appear in your anthology of limericks?&#10;&#10;In more detail, everyone has their own book and sits in a circle. The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud.

When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.&#10;&#10;",

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete.

If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play.

84876,ブルゴーニュ,"The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;There is a separate BGG entry for the 2019 edition: The Castles of Burgundy.

Your goal is to have only cards of a single mood in each stack.&#10;&#10;Once a round begins, all players simultaneously exchange exactly one card from one of their stacks with a card from the center of the table; exchanging cards from one stack to another is forbidden.

13,カタン,"In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

Not in this naughty game of cards &ndash; in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.&#10;&#10;In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.&#10;&#10;There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.&#10;&#10;Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)&#10;&#10;The action cards work as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.&#10;    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it.

Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier. After the first clue is given, players alternate giving clues.&#10;&#10;",
5782,コロレット,"Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!&#10;&#10;A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.&#10;&#10;Nordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'.&#10;&#10;",

243430,支離滅裂,"In Dealt!, first released as Krass Kariert (Checkered Combos), you don't necessarily win by going out first, but at least you don't lose the game.&#10;&#10;To start, each player receives three life tokens and two reserve cards at random, which they place face up in front of themselves. They then receive a hand of cards, the order of which they cannot change. The start player for a round leads by playing a combination of up to three cards, and these cards must be next to one another in that player's hand. A player can lay down a single card, a pair, a triple, or a run of two or three consecutive cards. Each player in turn must beat the combination, with a pair being beaten by a higher pair or a triple. If you cannot or will not play, you instead pick up one of your reserve cards, placing it where you choose within your hand. If you have no more reserve cards, then you must discard a life token.&#10;&#10;Once each player has played or passed, whoever played the highest combination wins that round and begins the next round. If a player must discard a life token but has none, this player loses the game and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;",
225694,デクリプト,"Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.&#10;&#10;Starting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, &quot;sucker-prince-stake&quot;. The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)&#10;&#10;The rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.&#10;&#10;",

Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.&#10;&#10;Game Objective&#10;The game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner. In order to gain points, you must bring the most ruins chips back to the submarine. You can only return to the submarine once per round, and you cannot progress more after returning. You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips.&#10;&#10;Turn Progression&#10;On their turns, players conduct steps 1-4 listed below. Players take turns, going clockwise around the board, and the round ends when all players have returned to the submarine, or if the air runs out at the beginning of someone's turn.&#10;&#10;1) Declare if you will turn back or not.&#10;2) Reduce air.&#10;3) Roll the dice and advance your game piece.&#10;4) Search.

Both of these feelings come together in D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, with players reacting to cards as they pass to grab repeated objects.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the 36 object tiles are spread out around the deck of cards. These objects are each pictured on cards in the deck exactly twice. The cards in the deck are revealed one by one, and if you think that an object on a card has appeared previously, then you can grab the corresponding object tile and place it in front of you. Are you sure of what you saw? You better hope so because if a newly revealed card matches an object tile lying in front of you &mdash; and an opponent spots that tile in time and identifies your false memory &mdash; then you're out of the rest of the round.&#10;&#10;Once you finish going through the deck, players score points for the items they collected. A total of three rounds are played, and with each subsequent round players might find it harder to remember exactly what they've seen.

15512,インカの黄金,"Diamant &mdash; also published as Incan Gold &mdash; is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.&#10;&#10;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.&#10;&#10;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;",

Begging is brilliant conceptually, but tricky in practice since no one has any money. You beg twigs from the villagers, and they beg them back, but no one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes. You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through. Still, you are sure that, as always, you will triumph over this adversity, or at least do slightly better than everyone else.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Dark Ages is the seventh addition to the game of Dominion. It contains 500 cards but is not a standalone game. It adds 35 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus new bad cards you give to other players (Ruins), new cards to replace starting Estates (Shelters), and cards you can get only via specific other cards. The central themes are the trash and upgrading. There are cards that do something when trashed, cards that care about the trash, cards that upgrade themselves, and ways to upgrade other cards.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;",

So now everyone's joining a guild, learning a craft, and working on a masterpiece &ndash; a painting so beautiful it blinds you, or a cheese grater so amazing that you never eat cheese again. The only people left tilling the fields are the ones doing it ironically. The guilds cover everything &ndash; ironic tilling, butchering, baking, candlestick making, shoemaking, cheesemaking, cheese destruction.

Players can win the game by winning two rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing two rounds.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Each round, the player sets up the base character &mdash; one of eight heroes in the box &mdash; and all the equipment this character has. This one character represents every player being a fully-equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;The start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn. If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and remove a piece of equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment currently on the character.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allows you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round; if not, they lose. The players then reshuffle all the cards to make a new monster deck and use the same or a different hero to start the boasting once again.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last person standing.&#10;&#10;Dungeon of Mandom VIII includes the material in the original Dungeon of Mandom as well as seven new heroes, seven new monsters, and forty new pieces of equipment, with those items having previously appeared in Welcome to the Dungeon and Welcome Back to the Dungeon.&#10;&#10;",

All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013.

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&#10;&#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror.

10,エルフェンランド,"Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).&#10;  &#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.&#10;&#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.&#10;&#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.

What are those categories, and how is an answer correct? Read on...&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out the yellow, green, and red loops so that they overlap like a Venn diagram and form seven specific regions: yellow-only, yellow-and-green, all three colors, etc. Each player represents one of these colors. Each player chooses a category in secret, with the category being something that can easily divide answers into &quot;belongs&quot; or &quot;does not belong&quot;. Examples might be things with four legs, foods, games by Reiner Knizia, things you can cut, and school subjects. Each player writes something that belongs in their category, then the other two players move those answers to the proper region. (If you're yellow, for example, you must give an answer that belongs in the yellow category, but that answer might also belong in the red or green category as well.)&#10;&#10;Following this set-up, on a turn one player places a token in one of the seven regions, e.g., inside the red and green categories but outside the yellow one. Each player now gives an answer that matches the status of their own category, then the other players say whether or not your answer is placed in their categories or not. If your answer fits within the proper region, then you score a point and leave the colored portion of your answer sheet visible; if it's not in the proper region, then you hide the colored portion (to show that you don't score), but leave the answer visible to give information to other players.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 1 point in all seven regions or to score 8 points total wins.&#10;&#10;",
33160,エンデバー,"It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!&#10;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your&#10;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&#10;&#10;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&#10;&#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw. Once all players have passed, a new round begins.&#10;&#10;",

The next player &mdash; and each player after that &mdash; must play cards to surpass that sum or else collect all of the cards played so far, after which they open with one or more cards.

444,ヒューゴ,"Although billed as a children's game, Escape from the Hidden Castle, a.k.a. Midnight Party or Hugo, is actually quite enjoyable by adults as a light, fun game. Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.&#10;&#10;Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.&#10;&#10;Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!&#10;&#10;",

177736,オーディンの祝祭,"A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today &mdash; a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.&#10;&#10;When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.&#10;In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.&#10;&#10;In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:&#10;A Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risk balanced against reward. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.&#10;&#10;Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.&#10;&#10;You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you&rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you&rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.&#10;&#10;",
216788,オーディンの祝祭：ノース人,"The first large expansion for A Feast for Odin, The Norwegians includes four new islands (Isle of Man, Isle of Skye, Islay, Outer Hebrides) with Irish coastal viking-settlements on the backside (Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Limerick), where people from Norway came to stay through the winter (longphort), to trade at, and to settle nearby. This offers new strategies and new puzzle-tiles like horse (6VP, 2x5 spaces)/pregnant horse/leather(green)/vadmal(blue) and pigs (1 VP, breed every round; 2x3 - 1 = 5 spaces)/herbal (orange)/ antler (green)/tools (blue). The game has a third box for the tiles and offers the four old islands too (renewed little different VPs and new graphic-aspects of mini-expansion islands Lofoten/Orkneys/Tierra del Fuego).&#10;&#10;The expansion includes another mountain-strip (last round), more two-silver coins, meat/beans and runes/oil and a &quot;little emigration&quot; piece that covers one food instead of two. You get it on a new action-space for giving away a whaling boat. The renewed action board has three pieces that can be turned around for different numbers of players (version for 1-2, 3, and 4 players), which increases the chances of players getting in each others way. It contains new opportunities like butchering, elk-hunting, fishing, and thievery, along with changes for some old actions. It's now easier, for example, to play an animal strategy, also because you can now get two of the same animals in one action. There is also a new fifth column to make a (better) action with your last viking! You can smith, for example, now a grey piece with maximum of eight swords by using an ore and only one action. Also for this, there are five new grey puzzle-pieces like pan, hauberk or anvil and a little board for smithable pieces with fewer than nine swords.&#10;&#10;Totally new is also the idea of a random start-building. Everybody gets one of the six artisan shed boards and can build the front or backside with one wood and one action. These buildings offer, covered like stonehouse and longhouse, some stuff (pieces, weapons, commodities), VPs and one silver (horse stable 2 silver). So everybody has another different start-opportunity - like the profession card. Another new option is, that instead of puting a profession card into the game, you can throw it away for a VP-chip. A nice little competitive element, because there are only two 4-VP-chips, six 3-VP-chips and eight (endless) 2-VP-chips.&#10;&#10;The expansion now includes almanac about game-elements and their viking-history. But again it was written by Gernot K&ouml;pke as a &quot;historical-science&quot;-journalist and learnd lokal newspaper editor and main elements will be published on BGG at Expansions-Almanac / Almanach f&#195;&#188;r Erweiterungen&#10;The expansion includes also an extra board for ships and small emigration tiles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",

Afterwards, players refill their hand.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;Players cannot share the numbers of the cards in their hand with other players but must find ways to collaborate in order to effectively place cards in the four piles so that all players can have zero cards in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If there is an exact difference of 10 between the card a player discards and the last card in a pile, the player is free to play the card regardless of the UP/DOWN direction of the pile.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;In Demons of Numbers, there are also six types of effect cards (which are number cards with an effect written at the bottom): Reverse, Skip, Short, Draw 2, Silence, and Declaration of Death.&#10;&#10;There are three types of ending results for the game: Total victory, victory, and loss.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Additional Information:&#10;&#10;This all new game builds upon the original The Game with additional rules for a spookishly fresh gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;Unlike The Game Extreme which added rules to make gameplay even more challenging for players, Demons of Numbers offers a more interactive, conversational experience. The new design also allows for up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Familiar &ldquo;effects&rdquo; are added to the game to give it a more UNO-esque familiarity. In fact, these changes have earned this version of the game the nickname &ldquo;The Game Junior&rdquo; by the original publisher.&#10;&#10;The increased player number, new rules, and random events make it more difficult for players to find a repeatable pattern to beat the game and result in a making Demons of Numbers more of a &ldquo;party game&rdquo; for all ages and for gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;&#10;The designer, 326, felt that the original The Game had a title that was really not ideally optimized for easy internet searches, as well as artwork that would make it for children to convince their parents to purchase the game for them. He wanted to take a new approach and was able to find a willing partner in Arclight Games.&#10;&#10;Illustrations are also by 326.&#10;&#10;",
236461,ザ・ゲーム　フェイス・トゥ・フェイス,"The Game: Face to Face features gameplay similar to The Game with players laying down cards from their hand in ascending and descending piles, but now the game is limited to two players who are competing to get rid of their cards first. You want to win on your own, but to advance, you must inevitably help your opponent...&#10;&#10;On your turn, you&rsquo;ll play at least 2 cards from your hand of 6. The twist comes from where you can play them. Of course, your own ascending and descending piles are fair game and follow the normal rules of The Game.&#10; But exactly once per turn, you can play a card on one of your opponent&rsquo;s piles, breaking all rules.

You can do so only as a real team! In more detail, to win you must play all fifty cards in the deck on the two discard piles. The deck consists of fifty cards, with cards coming in five colors numbered 1-10 in each color. Each player has a hand of two cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you play one or two cards onto one or both of the two discard piles. On one pile, you must play a higher card that whatever the top card is, and on the other, you must play a lower card. The exception is that you can play any card on a discard pile if it's the same color as the current top card. Thus, on the ascending discard pile the cards played might be blue 1, red 2, gray 4, yellow 6, yellow 2 &mdash; and that drop down gives you breathing room in which to play more cards.&#10;&#10;You can't reveal the specific numbers you have in hand, but you can say things like, &quot;I have a high yellow card.&quot; In the &quot;professional&quot; version of the game, you must play exactly one card each turn (even if you want to play two), and you can reveal only the color of cards in your hand and on which stack you want to play.&#10;&#10;",

9216,ゴア,"Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.&#10;&#10;After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.&#10;&#10;The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.&#10;&#10;",

With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.&#10;&#10;But no hotel can grow without guests. To choose wisely which guests to attract and to complete their orders brings some important bonus actions. The staff cards also have different advantages, but the game ends after seven rounds and no player can do everything they want, so whoever makes the right decisions and finds the best way to create bonus actions will win.&#10;&#10;With 116 different cards and a new set-up in each game, Grand Austria Hotel provides a huge replay value. Each game stands on its own and demands new tactics and strategies.&#10;&#10;",

These adventurers are there to collect as much of this rare resource as they can, while their rivals constantly try to steal it. You are one of these superstars on a quest for wealth, and you must overcome the gravitational challenges set before you!&#10;&#10;What is really original about Gravity Superstar is the manner in which the players' pawns move: Each turn, they move one or two spaces, then they are affected by gravity, which makes them fall until they are stopped by a platform. This effect is made possible by the fact that the pawns are used lying down on the board. Thus, they move up (above their head), down (below their feet), left, or right.&#10;&#10;During its movement, a pawn can collect stars (to score points at the end of the game) or replay tokens (to take a second consecutive turn), and eject opponents' pawns from the board.&#10;&#10;",

2944,ハリガリ,"Halli Galli is a speed action game in which players watch for sets of exactly five fruit. The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.&#10;&#10;The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.&#10;&#10;Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered. If, for example, cards showing 3, 1 and 4 bananas are on the table and the 3 is then covered by a non-banana card, suddenly five bananas are showing and somebody better be reaching for the bell.&#10;&#10;",

It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.&#10;&#10;There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare &amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&#10;&#10;&#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable. This is the rule I most favour and would prefer it to simply not landing on them at all...&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;      Tournament Jugging the Hare rule -- When you land on a hare square do nothing immediately.

129051,ル・アーブル 内陸港,"Le Havre: The Inland Port is a two-player game in which both players compete to become the richest harbormaster. How they do so? Players acquire resources, construct buildings and, after twelve rounds, score the total value of their buildings and their money in cash.&#10;&#10;Each round, a set of new, predefined buildings is added to the market. Both players now take turns by either building one of these buildings or by using an existing building's effects. To construct a building, players have to pay a certain amount of money and/or resources from their warehouse. Most of these buildings, in turn, allow to change the amount of resources on a player's warehouse board in a specific way when used. This is crucial to the game as players are restricted on how to fill or empty their warehouse. They have to combine and optimize these steps to max out the capacity of their warehouses. Players can even use their opponent's buildings, but they have to pay them one Franc (=money) to do so. When a building is not used during a round, it steadily increases in worth as its effects can be used up to four times in subsequent rounds. But a building that is not used for too long has to be sold to the market for half its value! The game uses an Ora et Labora-like wheel to track this status of each building in play.&#10;&#10;Although Le Havre: The Inland Port shares gameplay elements with Ora et Labora and is linked in theme with Le Havre, it is a distinct game with its own mechanisms and gameplay.&#10;&#10;",

265402,マウンテンキング,"Play as trolls rebuilding your abandoned kingdom under the mountain in In the Hall of the Mountain King. With muscle and magic, you'll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain. Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!&#10;&#10;Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.&#10;&#10;A major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources &mdash; gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers &mdash; that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a &quot;pyramid&quot;. The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.&#10;&#10;The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!&#10;&#10;",
116954,インディゴ,"Indigo is a tile-laying game along the lines of Metro, Tsuro, and Linie 1 in which players build paths bit by bit, with no player owning the individual paths and everyone trying to exploit the paths already present. Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move gemstones from their starting locations on the board to your designated goals, with the player who scores the most points winning the game.&#10;&#10;To set up the game board, place the central hex tile, then add five green gems and one indigo gem to it. Place six &quot;U-turn&quot; tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone &quot;moves&quot; as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. (Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.) When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection.&#10;&#10;If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!&#10;&#10;When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem. If two players own the goal, then both players collect a gem of that color, taking the extra gem needed from the reserve. Once all the gems have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for an indigo gem, 2 for green, and 1 for yellow. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

Players, in turn order, must then add a card, which must be alike either in the color or in the value as the first out-played. If the player is unable (or does not want) to play a card to match, they must take all the cards played thus far (and then start a new round). In the end, all the red cards in hand are worth their face value and all the rest of the cards are worth one point. After a number of rounds, the player with the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;",

One player is the &quot;master&quot;, and they secretly select a word from a set given in a deck of cards. (In a variant given in the rulebook, they can freely select and write down a word.) The &quot;insider&quot; player, whose role is not known to the other players, will then secretly view the word. The rest of the players are known as &quot;commons&quot;. The commons then have approximately five minutes in which to ask the master &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;-type questions so that they can deduce the secret word. The insider attempts to secretly lead the commons towards the correct word. If the commons fail to guess the correct word, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;If, however, the word is correctly guessed in the allowable time, the master flips the sand timer, and the commons and master have until the sand runs out to discuss the game and deduce the identity of the insider.

2452,ジェンガ,"A tower building game.&#10;&#10;Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.&#10;&#10;The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;&#10;&#10;According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.&#10;&#10;",

325698,ジューシィフルーツ,"Each player has their own small island paradise where they grow delicious fruit. To win, you must gain the most points by cleverly supplying ships and by adding the best businesses to your island.&#10;&#10;Your turn in Juicy Fruits works like this: First, you slide one of your fruit collector tokens a number of unblocked spaces and collect that many fruits of the token's type: banana, orange, lime, pomegranate, or mangosteen. Then you may either fulfill the order of a ship on your shores or claim a business from a shared display and place it onto your island (or do nothing). Clever planning and timing is vital because until you supply the ships on your shores, they block valuable island space which could be used to collect more fruit &mdash; but if you concentrate too much on the ships, the most promising businesses may get snatched by your opponents. Also, the sooner businesses are claimed, the quicker the game might end.&#10;&#10;With each play, Juicy Fruits poses new puzzles of how to move your tokens efficiently and how to balance clearing your island with claiming businesses. The game also includes an additional &quot;juice factory&quot; mode and four modes of solo play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
8098,ジャングルスピード,"In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.&#10;&#10;To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.&#10;&#10;Jungle Jam, &#208;&#156;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#180;&#208;&#178;&#208;&#181;&#208;&#180;, and Prawo D&#197;&#188;ungli are unauthorized reproductions of Jungle Speed/Arriba!&#10;&#10;",

Be unique, as all identical clues will be cancelled!&#10;&#10;A complete game is played over 13 cards. The goal is to get a score as close to 13 as possible. In case of a right answer, the players score 1 point. In case of wrong answer, they lose the current card as well as the top card of the deck. Thus losing 2 points. In case of lack of answer, the players only lose the current card, and therefore only 1 point.&#10;&#10;You have the choice &ndash; make the difference!&#10;&#10;Small Historical Point:&#10;&#10;Originally, Just One was called We Are The Word and was published by Fun Consortium.&#10;&#10;Repos Production bought the rights in early 2018 and adapted the game.

2448,マンカラ,"The most common rule set in games sold commercially as Mancala is for this game of Kalah.&#10;&#10;Mancala is actually a whole family of games.&#10;&#10;Kalah was invented in 1940 by an American, William Champion Jr..  He started selling the game in 1944, patented the rules in the 1950's, and founded the Kalah Game Co. in 1958.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called the Kalah.&#10;&#10;A player owns the six pits closest to them and the Kalah on their right side.&#10;&#10;The game is started with four (4) seeds in each pit.&#10;&#10;A player takes all the seeds from one of their pits, and then they are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the player's own Kalah, but not into the opponent's store (Kalah).&#10;&#10;If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into the player's Kalah, they must move again.&#10;&#10;If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, they capture all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in their Kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of their holes. The remaining pieces are captured by their adversary. The player who has captured the most pieces is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;Beginners may start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game can also be played with 5 or 6 seeds in each pit. William Champion Jr. recommended the expert game with 6 in each pit.&#10;&#10;",

In the game of Kamozza, you are exporters and your goal is to load as much of your freight as possible into ships.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has the same set of freight cards of various loads.&#10;&#10;There are two docks on the table. Each round, two ships come into these docks. The one of these two ships has larger load capacity, and the other has smaller. Then each player secretly chooses a freight card from their hand and destination ship to load the freight. When they are revealed, count up the load for each ship. If the load exceeds the ship's capacity, the ship is sunk. Otherwise freight is successfully loaded and victory points are scored to the successful players.&#10;&#10;After the fifth round, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is simple but exciting, and its artwork is cute. You can play another game using the same cards. You should load your freight from heavier to lighter, but if you and other player play the same card, both cards cancel each other and you miss a chance to load. This game is also exciting.&#10;&#10;The game was originally produced in 2012 in Japanese.

122515,キーフラワー,"Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.&#10;&#10;",

If you land on a lily pad of your color, you put your card back into your hand. Otherwise, you discard your card. If someone runs out of cards, they are eliminated from the game. The game also ends as soon as the person in front (the king frog) hops over the person in last place, in which case the king frog wins.&#10;&#10;",

Each round, each player chooses one of these and plays it hidden to the table. When everyone did, they are revealed. If two or more players chose the same card, these cards are negated. Otherwise the cards effects are resolved. They affect each players magical orb - a d12. After all cards are resolved, the values of the dice are compared.

But in some cases the smallest value may win... When only one card is left, players compare their points. Players with the same amount of points negate each other, then the player with the most points wins the round.

After choosing a monster, each player takes the eight Evolution cards associated with that monster, shuffles those cards, and creates a personal deck. At the end of a player's turn, if she has three hearts, she draws one Evolution card and adds it to her hand; this is possible even in Tokyo (when hearts are normally useless) and even if the hearts are used for some other action, such as healing.&#10;&#10;A player can reveal and play an Evolution card at any time. Some Evolutions are temporary, allowing a one-time bonus, while others are Permanent, such as Gigazaur's &quot;Tail Sweep&quot;, which allows him to change one die to a 1 or 2 each turn. Each Evolution card also identifies whether a monster is a Mutant, Invader, or Robot, and while not relevant for Power Up!, this species identification could come into play in future expansions.&#10;&#10;The rules for King of Tokyo: Power Up! contain a few variants: Players start with a random Evolution in play, or draw two cards and choose the one they want, or draft a set of Evolutions prior to the start of play.

Each turn, each player will select a new domino to connect to their existing kingdom, making sure at least one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. The order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen, with better tiles forcing players to pick later in the next round.

266083,ラマ,"In LLAMA, you want to dump cards from your hand as quickly as you can, but you might not be able to play what you want, so do you quit and freeze your hand or draw and hope to keep playing?&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand; the deck consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6, with eight copies of each. On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on the discard pile, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions in the round. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white tokens (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white tokens for one black token at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one token (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.&#10;&#10;The game ends the round that at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;The original title of this game is a German acronym and stands for Lege alle Minuspunkte ab, that is, &quot;lay down all the minus points&quot;, with &quot;Lama&quot; also being the German name for &quot;llama&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Polish game Lato z Komarami features gameplay nearly identical to LLAMA except that the game has one less &quot;llama&quot; card, and the penalty for llama cards in hand is 10 points per card, instead of being 10 points for one or more llama cards.&#10;&#10;",

At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;",

50,ロストシティ,"Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2&ndash;10 in five different colors with three special &quot;handshakes&quot; (&quot;HS&quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, &times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;",

On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.&#10;&#10;After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.&#10;&#10;Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!&#10;&#10;",

The deck consists of black, green, and gray cats (six each), blue and red cats (three each), golden cats (four), and eight music notes.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you reveal a card, then stop and collect that card or reveal another card. If you reveal a type of card that's already been shown, then your turn ends, you collect nothing, and all revealed cards are laid face-down again. If you stop before this, you collect the revealed cards except for a revealed note card, which is turned face down again. If you collect a blue and red cat, thereby reuniting the lovecats, you score 2 points; if you collect a pair of matching cats, you score 1 point. Golden cats are wild and can be paired with any color. You cannot use the same blue cat to score for both lovecats and a pair.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 8 points wins. You can do this solely by collecting cats, but another possibility is to start your turn by saying &quot;Note atsume&quot; (&quot;Collecting notes), then reveal only note cards &mdash; which are worth 1 point each &mdash; until you have a total of 8 points between cats and notes, thereby winning the game; if you flip anything other than a music note (i.e., a cat), your turn ends and you must hide those notes once again, while giving the cat card to the player on your left.

However, when collecting income you draw cards from 4 different mines (card stacks) with each having its own distribution! The number of gems you earn depends on the upgrade level of your dwarves. Gems are used to either win new objects for their mine through simultaneous 4-way auctions, or to enhance their mines, objects, and victory point count. Another innovative part is that each object has to be upgraded to fully use its benefits, e.g. a level 1 dwarf only gives you 1 income per round, some level 3 dwarves give you 3 income.&#10;&#10;On the King's way through the mountain, the requirements for upgrading some special cards always change, and only the player who wins the sapphire auction knows where the next turn will lead to.

A distinctive feature of this game is the multi-part board - there are four boards laid on top of each other, each with holes in it leading 'down' to the next level.  Players move their moles to those holes and, when one board is 'complete' (i.e., all holes occupied), the board, and any moles remaining on it, are removed from play.  Players continue working their way down from level to level, each board having fewer holes than the previous, until they reach the final level, which has only one hole leading to The Golden Shovel.  A simple race-to-the-finish game with fun, colorful playing pieces, just as much fun with or without the kids!&#10;&#10;This game is actually a mild re-working of Inner Circle, also called Top Star, by Virginia Charves. Thematically re-implemented as Up And Down.&#10;&#10;",

Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saut&eacute; them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.&#10;&#10;Morels, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms &ndash; sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough &ndash; earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.&#10;&#10;Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.&#10;&#10;",

219122,ナショナルエコノミー,"Is population a power or a burden?&#10;&#10;if the economy is doing well the population will increase, as the population increase, does it necessary mean that the productivity will also increase? In most worker placement games like Agricola, Stone Age that seems to be the case.&#10;&#10;This game plays like a typical worker placement game. At the first round each player has 2 workers and they take turn placing their workers one by one onto the basic tiles. The basic tiles consisted of quarry(get a card and take first player),mining(get a card), construction(build a building), Education(increase a worker). At the end of each round you'd have to pay your worker salaries. If you don't have enough money to pay for the workers this round, you'd have to sell some of your private properties and it'd become public to cover the cost.&#10;&#10;Here is the most interesting aspect about this game, unlike most other worker placement games, as long as you place workers in the farming/gathering tile the resource for feeding your people is unlimited, they can create enough food for themselves. In this game, the cash flow is limited even if you place the worker in the market tile you can only receive money up to the amount that is available in the pool. The only way to increase the money in the pool is when players cannot pay for their worker and sell their property to bring cash flow into the game, otherwise, there is no way to add more money. At the end of the game, the sum total of the selling prices of all the assets is the victory point.&#10;&#10;in this game, If you want to increase population, you can increase it as you like, but unlike other games, population will not score at all except for the effects of some buildings. On the contrary, if the workers cannot produce they will become a huge burden and consume the economy, making accumulation of wealth absolutely impossible.&#10;&#10;Essentially, this players have to learn to balance between development of population and the economy. Too few people can not maximize profits. However, if there are too many people they will eat up the profit. Initially, increased workers to increase productivity seems to be very attractive, but when the workers begin to be a burden in the latter half of the game. there is no way to reduce the workers. There is no family planning nor natural disasters, major famine, massacre and cultural revolution in this game. Once the population have increased and if the economic development does not catch up, you will quickly understand what it means to be debt.&#10;&#10;",

Workers are necessary to found colonies or to acquire  buildings and privileges, which exist in five categories and therefore encourage players to follow different strategies competing with each other.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the player who is most successful in combining his privileges with his achievements (colonies, factories, discoveries, shipyards, and churches) is the winner.&#10;&#10;",

280,古代ローマの新しいゲーム,"Neue Spiele im Alten Rom (or New Games in Old Rome (NGIOR)) is a compendium of games from Reiner Knizia. In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.&#10;&#10;(7 of the games are described below)&#10;&#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players&#10;&#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players&#10;&#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Mercator : 3-7 players&#10;&#10;This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.&#10;&#10;Imperium : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.&#10;&#10;Senator : 2-3 players&#10;&#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.&#10;&#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players&#10;&#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.&#10;&#10;Consul : 2-4 players&#10;&#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.&#10;&#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.&#10;&#10;",

Many great scientists, with their theories and ideas, changed and shaped our perception of the universe: Galileo Galilei, Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon and, above all, Sir Isaac Newton.&#10;&#10;In Newton, the players take the role of a young scientist who wants to become one of the great geniuses of this era. To reach their ultimate goal, they travel around Europe, visit universities and cities, study to discover new theories, build new tools and work to earn money.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds. Each round, every player plays five cards from their hand, and each played card allows the player to perform one of the many actions of the game. An action can have a variety of effects, which depend on the symbols on the board. At the end of the round, a player can take back all the cards except for one. One card has to remain on the board, which means that you give up one possibility of doing that action, but also that that very action will be carried out with greater strength. Fortunately, you can acquire new cards with additional powers to perform more actions.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, you calculate your final score, and the player with the most VP wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",
13308,ナイアガラ,"Niagara is set in the not particularly safe world of rushing waterfalls. In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.&#10;&#10;The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the falls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home. Niagara is distinguished by an innovative movement mechanic as well as a beautiful three-dimensional rendering of the waterfall setting.&#10;&#10; Expanded by: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Niagara: Diamond Joe&#10;     Niagara: The Spirits of Niagara&#10;&#10;&#10;",

After shuffling the deck of cards, draw and reveal the first card. Each player takes a number tile matching the card and places it on the table. With each new card drawn after that, each player takes the appropriate number tile, then adds it to the tiles that they already have in play, with each player building their own arrangement of tiles.&#10;&#10;The new tile must touch at least one other tile on the same level along one side of a square. A tile can also be placed on top of two or more other tiles as long as no part of the new tile overhangs the tiles below it; new tiles placed on this same level must touch at least one other tile, while also covering parts of at least two tiles and not overhanging.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been drawn and the tiles placed, players take turns calculating their score. A tile on the bottom level &mdash; the 0th level, if you will &mdash; scores 0 points; a tile on the 1st level above this is worth as many points as the number on the tile; a tile on the 2nd level is worth twice the number on the tile; etc. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value.  Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.

In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3&ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players play as well-off Parisians in the 14th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral. The primary game concept is original, but simple, card play players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter. However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. If one does one thing, then the other can't be done. Concentrating on one aspect means automatically ignoring another, which, above all others, is particularly dangerous in the case of the gradually approaching plague...&#10;&#10;After 9 exciting rounds and about 75 action-filled minutes, Notre Dame is over.

In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards.

Also, four new &quot;Lost Dreams&quot; cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Crossroads and Dead Ends&quot; introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color &quot;joker&quot;.

At the start of the game, shuffle the deck, then remove five cards from play unseen. Deal one card face-up to each player.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the lowest card is the first active player. She decides whether to &quot;hit&quot; &mdash; that is, be dealt another card &mdash; or forfeit the round. If she hits and is dealt a card that doesn't match a card she already has in front of her, then the next player clockwise becomes the active player; if the card does match, then the round ends, she keeps one of these matching cards as penalty points, then everyone else discards their cards and a new round begins with each player being dealt a card.&#10;&#10;If the active player forfeits, the round ends and she takes the lowest-valued card visible on the table as penalty points, then a new round begins. Penalty cards remain set aside, even if the deck is shuffled to continue play. If a player acquires more penalty points than the predetermined threshold, then the game ends and this player loses. (Alternatively, players can use coins to track scores between games, with the loser paying everyone one coin, paying her score in coins to the player with the lowest score, etc.)&#10;&#10;There are many versions of Pairs from Cheapass Games. The base game play is identical, but the artwork (and artist) vary across the versions. Some include special game rules relevant to the theme of the deck.

On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station.

161936,パンデミックレガシー　シーズン１,"Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;Part of the Pandemic series&#10;&#10;",

As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose.

Characters from Lewis Carroll's books such as Alice, The White Rabbit, and The Hatter are steadily invited to join this weird procession.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you play a card (from your hand of five) to the end of the parade. Unfortunately, that card might cause other cards to walk off the parade. These cards count as negative points in the end.&#10;&#10;The length of the parade line is important. If the number of the card you just played is less than the line length, you may receive the excess cards (counting from last played to the first of the line).

Then everyone plays one last card. From the four cards remaining in their hand, players choose two cards to add to his or her point piles. The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Normally, negative points are same the number on the card.

163412,パッチワーク,"In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)&#10;&#10;When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",

The more penguins you can fit in the pyramid, the better &mdash; but it's not that easy.&#10;&#10;In Penguin Party, players collectively build a pyramid of penguins, trying to empty their hands of cards along the way. The deck consists of 36 penguin cards: 8 green and 7 each of red, blue, yellow, and purple. Deal the deck out as evenly as possible, with the final card in a five-player game starting as the first card in the base of the pyramid.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either play a card to the left or right of the base of the pyramid, which can be at most eight cards wide, or play a card on a higher level of the pyramid so long as it's supported by two penguins, at least one of which is the same color as the card being played. If you cannot play a card, discard your hand face down and take as many penalty markers as the number of cards you didn't play. If you empty your hand, you can return two penalty markers previously collected to the supply.&#10;&#10;Play as many rounds as the number of players, with each player starting one of the rounds.

Getting the support of loyal nobles and talented artisans, building a magnificent burial chamber, making offerings to the Gods&hellip; here are the main tasks set for you. But the gods are looking at you and you will have to do your best in order to satisfy their demands. Each of your actions will be judged during the weighing of your heart.&#10;&#10;Pharaon is a game mixing resource management and worker placement into a single mechanism, thanks to its Wheel of Actions. It is located at the center of the gameboard, surrounded by 5 areas, representing the 5 actions featured in the game. Each round, the Wheel indicates which resource has to be spent for accessing the matching action. As the wheel rotates from one segment by the end of each of the 5 rounds, this access cost to actions fluctuates throughout the game. As a consequence, players have to plan their actions, anticipating which resources they may need for the next round. But there are a limited amount of available spots on the wheel, forcing you to watch your opponents, which resources they have, and what they may intend.&#10;&#10;How to play ?&#10;A game of Pharaon is played in 5 rounds, during which the players take turns one after the other, until everyone has passed. On their turn, a player performs one of the 5 actions on the board. The actions can provide Prestige Points (PP), determining who wins at the end of the game, but they can also help getting new resources for further turns. To be allowed to perform an action, the player has to pay its Access cost, by spending the resource indicated by the Wheel of Actions for the area in which they want to act. They then pay the Action Cost by spending the corresponding resources. The resource spent on the Wheel to access this area gets deducted from the Action Cost, if it can match. So, it is useful to anticipate the rotation of the Wheel for taking the actions at their best cost. But there is a limit on how many times an action can be performed, and your opponents may need the same as you. Moreover, the game will be closely watched by the Gods. You will have to fulfill as many of their demands as possible to get their support and some extra PP.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",

An individual game supports 2-5 players, while combined they support up to eight players.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out 30 cards in a grid (49 cards with 6-8 players) and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, light/dark, one/two arms, with/without sunglasses, and with/without popcorn. (As noted above, combining the two games adds a sixth attribute: pig/dog nose.) Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot;. The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card (two cards when playing with 6-8). If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;Whoever has collected the most cards when the game ends wins!&#10;&#10;",

3076,プエルトリコ,"In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;",

201,ローゼンケーニッヒ,"Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.&#10;&#10;The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&#10;&#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&#10;&#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.&#10;&#10;Rosenk&ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.&#10;&#10;",

Each player has a 5x5 slide puzzle with one tile missing.  At the beginning of each round, the &quot;Scrambler&quot;, a device that looks like a 3x3 Boggle grid with the cover on -- but using colored cubes instead of letters -- is shaken.  Players then try to make the 3x3 center of their puzzle match the Scrambler.&#10;&#10;",
811,ラミィキューブ,"The game is based on the traditional middle-eastern game of Okey. First created in the 1930s and sold in hand-produced versions until the late 1970s.&#10;&#10;Similar to the Rummy that you play with cards - you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits. This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com).&#10;&#10;",
200407,ラミー17,"Rummy 17 is a somewhat standard rummy game in that players want to meld sets and runs &mdash; and play cards on the sets and runs of others &mdash; in order to rid themselves of cards. A round ends whenever one player discards their final card, then everyone else loses 1 or 2 points for each card still in hand.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, five goal cards are chosen at random from the deck, and at the end of the round each player who has satisfied a goal card scores points for doing so. On a turn, a player draws the top card from either the deck or the discard pile; if they draw from the deck, then other players have the option of knocking to take the top card from the discard pile. A player must lay down a set or run of at least three cards before being able to play on opponents' sets and runs, and a player must discard one card at the end of their turn, including their final turn when they go out.&#10;&#10;After a predetermined number of rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Rummy 17 includes one joker card in each of the five suits, with each suit being numbered 1-17. A player can use the joker when laying down a run as long as the run includes at least three numbered cards. This joker can be replaced with the actual number on a later turn as long as the player who does so immediately uses the joker in a new run.&#10;&#10;",

As in most zombie games, you represent a unique character with your own character traits, except in Run, Fight, or Die! you will also have your own individual board with zombies you alone will encounter.  Zombies move closer to you every round. You run from location to location, searching for weapons and survivors in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. In either case,  every survivor provides you victory points.  The game ends either when one player finds five survivors and declares the last round, or when a player reaches the town line (and the total Followers in play meets a minimum), or if a player gets bitten and turns. Be careful, some followers may turn against you, while others can slow you down. When it comes right down to it, the choice is simple: Run, Fight, or Die!&#10;&#10;Scoring is based on the total points of survivors and remaining health of the players&rsquo; characters.&#10;&#10;Run, Fight, or Die! is a frantic first person experience for 1 to 4 players (will play up to 6 with the 5/6 player expansion).

144733,ロシアンレールロード,"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.&#10;&#10;The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;",

But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.&#10;&#10;Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.&#10;&#10;The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.&#10;&#10;The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.&#10;&#10;Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.&#10;&#10;Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.&#10;&#10;The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.&#10;&#10;Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins.

229220,サンタマリア,"Santa Maria is a streamlined, medium complexity Eurogame in which each player establishes and develops a colony. The game features elements of dice drafting and strategic engine building. The game is low on luck and has no direct destructive player conflict; all components are language independent.&#10;&#10;In the game, you expand your colony by placing polyominoes with buildings on your colony board. Dice (representing migrant workers) are used to activate buildings; each die activates a complete row or column of buildings in your colony. The buildings are activated in order (left to right / top to bottom), then the die is placed on the last activated building to block this space. It is therefore crucial where you put new buildings in your colony, and in which order you use the dice.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, you produce resources, form shipping routes, send out conquistadors, and improve your religious power to recruit monks. When you recruit a monk, you must decide if it becomes a scholar (providing a permanent special ability), a missionary (for an immediate bonus) or a bishop (for possible end game points). The player who has accumulated the most happiness after three rounds wins. The available specialists, end game bonuses and buildings vary from game to game, which makes for near endless replayability.&#10;&#10;",

In this latter case when a player overplays another set, the player captures the cards in this previous set and places them face down in front of themselves.&#10;&#10;&bull; Scout: A player takes a card from either end of the set currently on the table and places it anywhere they wish in their hand in either orientation. Whoever played this previous set receives a 1 VP token as a reward for playing a set that wasn't beaten.&#10;&#10;Once per round, a player can scout, then immediately play.&#10;&#10;When a player has emptied their hand of cards or all but one player have scouted instead of playing, the round ends. Players receive 1 VP for each face-down card, then subtract one point for each card in their hand (except if they were the player scouted repeatedly to end the game). Play as many rounds as the number of players, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;",
320,スクラブル,"In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard.  Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow &amp; Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood. The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.&#10;&#10;",
169786,サイズ 大鎌戦役,"It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;",

Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!&#10;&#10;Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:&#10;&#10;The first phase &quot;Prelude&quot; consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish your own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.&#10;&#10;Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate their 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. They will begin the second phase of the game with their first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, they will receive the other two packets of three cards.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).&#10;&#10;These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: &#10;- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) &#10;- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards&#10;- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. &#10;- Draw new cards&#10;&#10;Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the &quot;time track&quot; would move forward.&#10;In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the &quot;exchange rates&quot; of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable). The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;",

Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined.&#10;&#10;All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.&#10;&#10;To play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.) Whoever claims the most sets wins!&#10;&#10;",

The game is produced on A4 sheets which the player cuts up into cards accordingly.&#10;&#10;By an unexpected turn of events, you're attending a movie forum to discuss movies you've never heard of. You need to comment on the movies as if you know them thoroughly.&#10;&#10;Combine two title cards to form an imaginary movie title. Once the movie title is determined, take turns to discuss the movie. You may say whatever comes to your mind about the movie. Other players may also talk to back up your speech. Note that other players must agree with whatever you say about the movie. As the turn player, make a speech for about 30 seconds and then address the next player.&#10;&#10;When all the players have made their speech, they shall concurrently appoint a player whose speech has impressed them the most. The player who is selected by the highest number of players shall win the title as the best know-it-all movie critic!&#10;&#10;Its 2nd Edition, which will be released at Game Market Tokyo 2015 Autumn,

9851,シャットザボックス,"The game 'box' has levers labelled from one to nine. (There are also sets made with 1-12.)&#10;&#10;Initially all the levers are in the 'up' position.&#10;&#10;The first player rolls two dice.  He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:&#10;&#10;One number which is the combined value of both dice.&#10;&#10;Or...&#10;&#10;Two numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.&#10;&#10;For example:&#10;&#10;If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.&#10;&#10;The player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 &amp; 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)&#10;&#10;The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, &amp; 6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to &quot;shut the box&quot; you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.&#10;&#10;In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game.

Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&#10;&#10;",
150145,スカルキングレジェンド,"Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to 'Oh Hell!', 'Wizard', 'Euchre' and 'Spades', with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.&#10;&#10;Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).&#10;&#10;Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;",
8129,ウィザードエクストリーム,"The gameplay for Sluff Off! follows the standard trick-taking formula: The cards are numbered 1-15 in five different suits, and blue is always trump. If someone leads a color, you must follow suit if you can; otherwise, you can throw off a card or trump the trick.&#10;&#10;It's an exact-bidding game, but you predict your tricks by taking colored chips. For each trick that you win, you toss a chip back. If you take a trick in a color for which you didn't have a chip, then you must take a black chip (worth -3 points). If you have any colored chips left at the end of the round, they're worth -2 points. If you have any white chips left at the end of the round (wildcards that you get when someone takes a colored chip away from you during bidding), they're worth -4 points.&#10;&#10;There's also the Sluffer, whose role is to feed unwanted tricks to other players. Instead of bidding tricks the Sluffer takes 4 black chips each worth -1 for him at the end of the hand. When players take tricks they didn't predict, they take black chips from the Sluffer. If the Sluffer feeds enough of the black chips to other players, it can zero out the Sluffer's score for that round.&#10;&#10;",

Each bird is a different colour in the game.&#10;&#10;Players are forest spirits, trying to secretly guide their chosen bird to success. The cards are numbered 1 to 7 in red, blue, green and white. The players lay a card from their hand to a 5x5 grid after nut tokens (points) are laid out for each row and column.&#10;&#10;When the grid is full of cards, the rows and columns are checked. The colour with the highest total in a line takes the nut token for that bird. Colours with tied totals are ignored, so a low value card can win the nut token for that bird.&#10;&#10;When the nuts are totalled up for the birds, the players reveal their final hand card. That card is the bird they favoured (so more than one player might be helping the same bird), and for each player, the number on the card is added to the nut total to identify who has the dominant bird.&#10;&#10;Since the players choose which bird they favour by leaving it as their final hand card, they can delay this choice until they see how the game is panning out.&#10;&#10;The game rules come in Japanese and English, the game itself being language free.

162886,スピリットアイランド,"In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.&#10;&#10;Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.&#10;&#10;The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.&#10;&#10;The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.&#10;&#10;The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.&#10;&#10;At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony).

On a turn, you swap tiles with a fellow player, then draw 1-2 tiles and add them to your collection. When you swap, you choose an opponent, then take all the tiles of one group (matching symbol &amp; matching color) and add it to your collection. Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it's impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.&#10;&#10;When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side. No one can take these tiles from you.&#10;&#10;After the last tile is drawn, each player takes one final turn, then players score points &mdash; but only for the complete groups that they've collected. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Stingy includes two-player rules that introduce a ghost pirate with whom players can trade, a variant in which players also score points for the number of differently colored groups they collect, and a &quot;Captain Sly&quot; variant in which an opponent who can't take tiles worth at most what you took gets nothing.

In the subsequent guessing phase, all players (including the dealer) guess which player got the same word as the dealer.

146508,タイムストーリーズ,"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The T.I.M.E Agency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&#10;&#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&#10;&#10;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Official FAQ&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Expansions were published in this order:&#10;&#10;Asylum (base game) (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: The Marcy Case (2015)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: A Prophecy of Dragons (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Under the Mask (2016) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Expedition &#226;&#128;&#147; Endurance (2017) &#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Lumen Fidei (2017)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Estrella Drive (2017)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Brotherhood of the Coast (2018)&#10;T.I.M.E Stories: Madame (2019)&#10;&#10;The Expansions link below also includes many fan-made expansions.&#10;&#10;",

In each version, the object of the game revolves around using a plastic axe to tap a tree made out of individual flat segments without causing any segments to fall out of the tree.&#10;&#10;Tok Tok Woodman First edition:&#10;A very simple dexterity game with 12 large wooden discs, a wooden axe, and a die. The discs are stacked as a tower. A player turn consists of rolling the die and then hitting the tower with the axe. For example, if you roll a five, you have to hit the fifth disc five times with the axe. The player causing the tower to fall loses.&#10;&#10;Toc Toc Woodman Second edition: &#10;A dexterity game where nine plastic tree segments are stacked up.  Each tree segment has four bark sections around it.  On their turn, a player gets two taps with the axe to try and knock off pieces of bark from the tree segments for one point a piece. But be careful, if a tree segment comes down it's minus 5 points! A quick unique dexterity game.&#10;&#10;Click Clack Lumberjack First edition:&#10;Very similar to Toc Toc Woodman Second edition, but adds some optional grub stickers which you may apply to bark pieces in order to add various rules for the grub.

The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;",

118048,タルギ,"Theme and overview:&#10;&#10;Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.&#10;&#10;The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.&#10;&#10;The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.&#10;&#10;",

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

Place wooden guards on the clover tiles and two of the positive tiles as indicated in the rules. Each player has three tokens (two in a five- or six-player game) that start at the beginning of the path.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the die, then move one of your tokens that many spaces down the path. If your token is the only one on a tile when you leave it, you collect that tile, which shrinks the path on which everyone is moving. If a guard is still on a tile when you leave it, you do not collect the tile. If any player's token is on the same space as a guard, you can move that guard instead of moving one of your own tokens, possibly setting someone else up for misfortune on a future turn and possibly setting yourself up for goods things &mdash; as long as no one else lands on your tile!&#10;&#10;Once your token reaches the final space on the path, that token is retired from play. Once all tokens are retired, players tally their points, with each clover you possess turning a negative tile into a positive one. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Verflixxt! includes a number of variants, including one in which you construct the path by laying out the tiles at random instead of in a particular order. The 2020 version of Verflixxt! uses this variant for its basic set-up, with the addition of a double-sided &quot;give/steal&quot; tile placed after every eighth tile on the path. When you collect tiles in this version of play, you place them in a tower, with your most recently collected tile on top. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;give&quot; tile, you must give your topmost tile to another player, giving a negative token to whoever has the most positive token on top and vice versa; you then flip the &quot;give&quot; tile to its &quot;steal&quot; side. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;steal&quot; tile, you take the topmost tile from whichever player you choose, then place it on top of your stack.&#10;&#10;For an even trickier variant, you can play that the clover tile affects only the tile directly beneath it in your stack, turning a positive negative and a negative positive. Now the clover isn't always so attractive!&#10;&#10;",

30869,テーベ,"Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Jenseits von Theben&#10;&#10;&#10;",

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;",
215,ティチュー,"Tichu took much of its rules and mechanics from Zheng Fen. It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.&#10;&#10;The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.&#10;&#10;The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses &mdash; but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call &quot;Grand Tichu&quot; after looking at only their first eight cards for a &plusmn;200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).&#10;&#10;The first team to 1,000 points wins.&#10;&#10;",

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.&#10;&#10;More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.&#10;&#10;The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards.

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up taxi, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until someone has no more than two taxis in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for the routes that they've claimed during the game, the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their taxis), and the tourist attractions that they've reached with their taxis. You lose points for any uncompleted destination tickets, then whoever has the high score wins!&#10;&#10;",
349992,タイガー&ドラゴン,"Players in Tiger &amp; Dragon play tiles from their hand to participate in waves of attack and defense. Be the first player to empty your hand to score points based on whichever one of ten scoring cards are in use this round.&#10;&#10;The game contains 38 tiles: 36 numbered tiles with one 1, two 2s, etc. up to eight 8s, along with a tiger and a dragon. Shuffle the tiles face down, then each player takes tiles based on the player count, with the round's starting player taking one additional tile. With four players, for example, the starting player draw ten tiles and all other players nine. At least one tile will remain out of play.&#10;&#10;The start player attacks by playing a tile from their hand. The next player can either pass or defend the attack by playing the same tile. Note that the dragon defends against any odd-numbered tile and the tiger against any even-numbered tile. After defending, place a tile of your own to attack. If a player passes, the next player either passes or defends. If all other players pass on your attack, place a tile from your hand face down, then choose a new tile to attack again. If you attack with the dragon or tiger, a player can defend with any odd- or even-numbered tile, respectively.&#10;&#10;The first player to empty their hand wins the round and scores points based on the last tile that they played and the specific scoring card for that round. They score 1 bonus point for each time an attack of theirs went undefended. At the end of a round, if a player has scored 10+ points, they win.&#10;&#10;Tiger &amp; Dragon is based on the popular Japanese traditional game GOITA, and it can be played with team rules like that earlier team. Teammates sit across from one another, and the first team to collectively score 15+ points wins.&#10;&#10;",

However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.&#10;&#10;Be careful, if the road angle is too steep you&rsquo;ll have trouble placing cars!&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#161; Branching out to two-ways&#10;You may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.&#10;&#10;Constructing Exit to Highway&#10;&#10;If you can ground a road safely to the table from a height of 1 pillar, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent&rsquo;s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You cannot start a new road from the exit.&#10;&#10;Penalty&#10;&#10;If you drop your opponent&rsquo;s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty.

There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;&#10;1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway&#10;The first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.&#10;&#10;2.

Many Cinderellas have gathered; who will be recognized as the real &quot;Cinderella&quot; by the Prince?&#10;&#10;In game terms, the deck of cards is shuffled and each player receives four cards. The person with the smallest feet starts first. A player wins a round when she has the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. To find the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella, each player lays down a card. The card dictates which card will be or won't be the real Cinderella. When a card is laid down, everyone secretly votes whether or not they want the new rule for that round. This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella.

When laying out cards for suggested stops, players need to both match colors and build them in ascending order &mdash; but they also need to bring passengers to this tram line in order to score victory points for it.&#10;&#10;The cards resemble postcards that feature street cars in Munich and historical parts of the city.&#10;&#10;",

173092,,"Each player in Tr&auml;xx has an erasable game board that features lots of colored hexagons shaped into a larger hexagon, with the numbers 2-10 being scattered across this playing area. While the color and number arrangement is the same on all player boards, the starting point differs on each board. (The second edition of Tr&auml;xx includes a pad of individual score sheets instead of erasable boards.)&#10;&#10;To play, shuffle the deck of fifteen cards, then reveal the top card, which will show four or five colored hexagons. Playing at the same time, each player takes an erasable pen and draws a path on their game board &mdash; with this path starting at or at least passing through the starting point on their board &mdash; that covers up to as many hexagons as were revealed, with the colors of the hexagons in your path matching those shown on the card. Thus, if the card shows two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow, then your path can cover at most two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow.&#10;&#10;Once all players have drawn their path, reveal the next card, continuing the path in either direction and covering only as many hexagons of the proper colors as is shown on that card. A path cannot cross itself.&#10;&#10;When your path crosses a number, call out that number. If you're the first one to reach it, you'll score that many points at game end; if others have reached it first, you score half this many points, rounded up.

242325,トリックと怪人,"Tricks and the Phantom is a simple deduction game using only ten (or eleven) cards with a little bluffing element. Deduce the culprit from among the four persons. However, there may be a &quot;phantom&quot; who attempts to confuse you.&#10;&#10;In the base game, ten cards are dealt to four players, so players have hands of only two or three cards. As in a trick-taking game, each player plays one card face down in turn order. While doing this, each player forecasts who has the highest card (that is, the culprit). Each card has a color (suit), and you have to show that color when you play the card; this allows opponents to narrow down the number of your card, but some cards have a special effect, so big numbers don't win automatically. Points are awarded to whoever played the highest card (the culprit) and to whoever correctly forecasted that player winning.&#10;&#10;Tricks and the Phantom is not just card luck. It is a strategy inference game that requires you to read each other's psychology.&#10;&#10;",

A player is chosen to moderate, and the rest of the players, up to 4, stand on the play mat with their feet on different spots.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of the moderator spinning a spinner, which gives a result matching a random color with a random element from the set (left hand, right hand, left foot, right foot). Each player must put the relevant bodypart on the relevant color spot. If the bodypart is already on a spot of that color it is moved to another spot of the same color. No two players bodyparts can share the same spot.

949,ツィクスト,"Twixt is a 2-player abstract game invented by Alex Randolph. TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;",

Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located &quot;later&quot; on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you &ndash; but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;The game ends after one full revolution of the central Tzolkin gear. There are many paths to victory. Pleasing the gods by placing crystal skulls in deep caves or building many temples are just two of those many paths...&#10;&#10;",
16986,ウボンゴ,"In Ubongo, players compete to solve individual puzzles as quickly as they can to get first crack at the gems on hand for the taking.&#10;&#10;Original edition:&#10;The game board consists of six rows, with twelve gems (of various colors) placed in these rows. At the start of play, each player places their pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.&#10;&#10;Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.&#10;&#10;2015 edition:&#10;The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem. Whoever scores the most gem-points after nine rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;",

119391,イルベッキオ,"Il Vecchio is set in the 15th century, when Cosimo de Medici &ndash; also called &quot;Il Vecchio&quot; (&quot;the Elder) &ndash; and his family ruled over Tuscany and its capital Florence. The players represent the heads of Florentine families trying to rise their families to power. To achieve this, they send out their family members to locations in Tuscany to perform various tasks, specifically to recruit followers (knights, assassins, abbots) and collect money as both are needed to take control of provinces in neighboring regions; controlled provinces provide power and a bonus action. Another task is to gain the favor of the squirearchy as these favors are indispensable when it comes to getting an official position in Florence, e.g., a seat on the town council to enhance actions in Tuscany, or a noble rank to gain power at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To complete these tasks, however, a proper middleman must be present at a location, and as these middlemen travel a lot, they are rarely met. That's why it is so important to have one's family members in the right place at the right time &ndash; to save on time and money while achieving one's goals.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has four family members in Tuscany. Players take turns performing exactly one action. Before his action, a player may pay money to move one of his own family members to another location. The available actions are to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a location-specific action in Tuscany. This requires both a middleman and one of your own standing (active) family members at that location. After the action, this family member is laid down (inactive).&#10;    Travel to another region and take over a province, which costs both followers and money.&#10;    Travel to Florence where you'll spend scrolls (and possibly money) to claim a city council or nobility tile.&#10;    Introduce a new family member to the board.&#10;    Raise all lying family members on the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when the &quot;Power of the Medici&quot; has faded, as indicated by a diminishing pile of crest tiles. Certain actions require you to remove such a tile, and the game ends when they're all gone. Players then sum their power points &ndash; earned for gained tiles and majorities in the regions and Florence &ndash; for a final scoring, and the player with the most power wins.&#10;&#10;",
2596,ヴィラパレッツィ,"An architectural rush to the skies for 2 - 4 budding architects with a good head for heights from 8 years old.&#10;&#10;In the land where the Lemons bloom, there once lived a wise old sage, whose friends called him &quot;Paletti&quot; He only had one goal in life, to finish the wonderful castle in the sky that his grandfather had begun to build many years before, but which had been left unfinished when the ducats ran out. Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?  All he needed to do was remove some of those holding up the first floor, of which there were far too many in any case, and rebuild them further up, so that they could support new floors,  reaching up towards the skies!&#10;&#10;&quot;Excellent, Paletti&quot; shouted his friends, and they quickly started to work.  Soon they had a marvelous building in front of them, the &quot;Villa Paletti&quot;. Nowadays, no one knows what it was caused the collapse of the Vila Paletti, perhaps a puff of wind, or a slight earth tremor, but all the experts are united on one point, that Paletti,  far ahead of his time, was the first to discover something whose full importance is only now starting to become clear to us, the Euro pallet!&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Palazzo Paletti&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;",
183394,ワイナリーの四季,"In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.&#10;&#10;The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.&#10;&#10;Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.&#10;&#10;Using those workers and visitors, the vineyard owners can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines, and filling wine orders, working towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.&#10;&#10;Viticulture Essential Edition includes the base game of Viticulture and a few of the most popular modules from the original Tuscany expansion, including Mamas &amp; Papas, Fields (previously known as Properties), expanded and revised Visitors, and Automa cards for a solo variant, along with a few minor rule changes.&#10;&#10;",

171623,マルコポーロの旅路,"In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.&#10;&#10;In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. Each action requires the use of one or more dice, and can be collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts or traveling on the board. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having trading posts in the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.&#10;&#10;",
187727,ペアネコ,"The Waltzing Cat is a two-player game that consists of eleven wooden blocks, with each of those blocks depicting two differently-colored cats on opposite sides. Gold cats show up five times, red and blue four times, and white, black and green three times; no color is repeated on a block with another color that appears the same number of times, e.g., red doesn't share a block with red or blue, but it does with the other four colors.&#10;&#10;To set up, shuffle the blocks without looking at them, then set them up so that each player can see only one side of each block. The player who sees more gold cats takes the first turn. On a turn, a player pushes a block away from them (so that it falls on the table), pulls a block toward them, or declares the end of the game. If you push a block and the face that lands facing up appears on another face-up block, then you keep the block that you just pushed over. If you pull a block &mdash; thereby revealing a face that you haven't seen &mdash; and the face that lands facing up appears on another face-up block, then you keep both matching blocks.&#10;&#10;If you declare the end of the game, the other player takes turns either pushing or pulling blocks (claiming blocks when appropriate) until no further matches can be made; the player who claimed the end of the game then takes all remaining face-up blocks.&#10;&#10;Players then tally their scores for the face-up cats in their collection. Each gold cat is worth 2 points, while each non-gold cat is worth 1 point. A pair of one blue and one red cat is worth an additional 3 points (for 5 total points). Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",

Each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining bidding cards and reveal them simultaneously.  For positive prizes, the highest card gets the prize; For negative prizes, the lowest card is stuck with the prize.

On the table, there is a space to hold 16 cards in 4 x 4 square grid, and each row and column represents reputation of a winery in which players may invest.  Each turn, you have two options: you may place a rating card, which ranges from -3 to +5, in the square grid, affecting two wineries; or you may place two investment tokens on any wineries.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, the first majority investor on each winery takes the reputation score on that winery.

This challenge is complicated by the deck containing eight cards each of numbers 1-7, with half the cards being red and half blue &mdash; which means almost every set of eight cards will sum to more than 10!&#10;&#10;The trick is that certain combinations of cards are worth less than their face value:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Three cards of the same color and number = 0&#10;    Three red cards in sequence are worth only the highest number in the sequence, so a red 345 = 5.&#10;    Three blue cards in sequence are worth only the lowest number in the sequence, so a blue 345 = 3.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a hand of eight cards. On a turn, draw a card from the deck, then (if you don't have a sum of 10) discard a card in a row in front of you; alternatively, you can pick up the discarded card of the player before you, add two cards from your hand to this card, play it beside you as a special sequence (a &quot;get&quot;), then discard a card. The cards in that &quot;get&quot; cannot be altered for the remainder of this deal, but they still count as being in your hand toward the desired sum of 10.&#10;&#10;When someone does reach a sum of 10, whether by drawing a card or picking up a discarded card, the round ends, with players scoring points based on the combinations they've made and certain conditions in their hand. Having only one 7 in hand is worth 1 point, for example, as is having four red and four blue cards, whereas having all cards of one color or two triples are each worth 3 points. You also score points for being the one to end the round.&#10;&#10;Play enough rounds so that each player starts a hand twice, then whoever has the most points wins.

358311,,"&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#191;! (DEKITA!) is a tile game from Japan. The theme is apprentice wizards learning how to form spells. But the gameplay is more abstract and somewhat language free.&#10;&#10;The 'spells' are formed by placing tiles to construct shapes. Each tiles has four triangles, which match to neighbouring tiles to make squares. The triangles are coloured red, green and blue, or rainbow as jokers. Coloured sides must match up.&#10;&#10;The spells are shown on theme cards, and have simple patterns of squares, such as an L shape, or a V shape. When a player has built a pattern of squares that match the shape and colour of a them card they hold, they can reveal the card as a competed spell. The first player to get to three completed spells wins the game.&#10;&#10;A player can swap theme cards in hand for a public pool, or draw from the deck.&#10;&#10;Players also have item cards, which allow the tiles to be changed. So a quill lets a player rotate a tile. A pocket lens lets a play change a square's colour. By careful use or tiles and items, a player can complete their spells faster.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 2017, and a second edition was published in 2018 with revised card design.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

In this game, players try to convey meaning of the answer with fewest characters possible.&#10;&#10;One player is assigned as the Answerer (respondent). The other players see the answer word. Then they reword the answer and write it down in katakana (Japanese syllabic characters) on their board secretly. They may not include the answer itself or direct translation of the answer in their reword.&#10;&#10;When all players except the Answerer have finished re-wording, one of them becomes the Caller and reads out the Caller's re-word. If the Answerer replies with correct answer, the Caller scores points. Otherwise the next player becomes the Caller and does the same.&#10;&#10;The order of Caller is determined by how short their re-word is.

(&quot;Hotta Imo Ijinna&quot; is a Japanese sentence which means &quot;Don't tamper with these potatoes harvested.&quot;)&#10;&#10;The game has dozens of cards, each of which has some foreign words written in it. Each round, players take one of these cards and hear how the words on the card sound through Google Translator (URL is known from the card). Each player then writes down what they heard in Japanese. They score points if their answer is the same as someone else. After several rounds, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;Because this game uses Google Translator, internet access with a speaker is required to play it.&#10;&#10;The designer chose three languages that are uncommon in Japan: Telugu, Thai, and Urdu. The designer liked the beautiful shape of the characters, and that they are unusual in Japan, so players cannot imagine their pronunciation.

The 70 card deck has English letters on one side, and corresponding Hiragana on the other. With all the hiragana (including the dakuon and semi-voiced sounds) and the first letter of the romanised form (a for a, k for ki) written on both sides.&#10;&#10;There are three different ways to play with the cards.&#10;&#10;1) &#227;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#189;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136; Rustle Alphabet&#10;Players put the cards spread out on the table, with the side with the roman alphabet facing up. Players choose a theme and have a limited amount of time to collect cards to make up words in Japanese that are associated with the theme. Players take up cards to make a word, seeing the Hiragana side.&#10;&#10;For example, if the theme is 'summer', then players could make japanese words like &#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#139; (watermelon), &#227;&#129;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138; (sunflower), &#227;&#129;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#138; (bon odori), &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#143; (uchiwa) and so on. But players can only see the roman letters on the table and there is only one card for each Hiragana. So if a player uses the R card for the Hiragana &#227;&#130;&#138; (ri) in sunflower, then another player will not be able to complete 'bon odori'.&#10;&#10;2) &#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#186; Three Letters&#10;The deck is shuffled and players are dealt three hand cards. Players hold their cards with the roman alphabet facing out to the other players.&#10;&#10;In turn, players draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand. A player is trying to get to a Japanese word using the Hiragana that they see. Once they have a word, they declare, and other players have 20 seconds to guess the word they've made from seeing the roman letters.&#10;&#10;For example, if the player is showing KNK as their three cards, is their word &#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#147; (mushroom), or &#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#147; (Kinko), or &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#141; (Konki)?&#10;&#10;3) &#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#186; Misty Memories&#10;This is a team game played in 2 v 2 or 3 v 3.&#10;&#10;Players are at a reunion, having a nice conversation.

The theme is decided by the letters on top of the deck, such as N &rarr; &quot;The moment I wanted to cry&quot;. Then one team asks the other team to tell a story, using the roman letters to make a word key to the story. For example &quot;Tell us about that time when you really wanted to cry. It was about... TKS!&quot; The challenged team has to reach into their memories, and recount a story using a Japanese word formed from TKS and vowels.

Players race to identify a word that fits the topic, and starts and ends accordingly.

339301,,"&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#138;&#180; (Jinrou) is a werewolf style game from Japan, set in a business company. The title &#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#138;&#180; means Human Labour (essentially the HR dept), and is a homonym of &#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188; (Jinrou) which means werewolf.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds and the players have different roles in the company, each with various skills needed to complete projects. Each role also has secret goals, and players are trying to achieve their goals by the end of the game to win, or to avoid goals and not lose!&#10;&#10;In a round, the team leader chooses three players to work on a project. These players (could include the leader) submit two skill cards in secret, which are shuffled and played up. If the six cards show certain combinations, then a player might win or lose on the spot.&#10;&#10;But if players can work out what role a person has, they can determine their goals, and play skill cards to make them fail, or make themselves win. By disguising their own roles, players have more chances to achieve their objectives and avoid being eliminated.&#10;&#10;For example, the CEO does not want to be in four projects, because they will die of over work. The Lazybones wants the CEO to die, or wants the projects to fail so they don't have to work. The Secretary wants to find romance with anybody but the Lazybones. The Temps want to be in four projects so they get hired permanently, and so on. And everyone wants to fall in love with the Secretary.&#10;&#10;Lazybones will win the game if the projects fail to complete, or if the diligent workers fail to take their vacations or miss out on romancing the Secretary.&#10;&#10;The various goals and possible outcomes means winning the game  depends on concealing roles and identifying others'.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;&#10;This is a game about hiding your identity. You are an employee of a company and you are involved in a secret project, hiding your true identity from each other. You have to achieve your goals while taking care of your paycheck and your love life!&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of cards that matches his or her abilities, and they all work together to move a single piece through the backgammon of event cards (i.e. projects) towards the goal.&#10;There is also a lot of fun to be had in the squares where the pieces stop.

Like other murder mystery games, deduction and discussion are the core elements of this game, but there's no hidden identity mechanism as there's no crime or suspect.&#10;&#10;Story:&#10;Five gamers gathered at a convention and played several games. When the convention was about to end, they found a monastery tile was missing from Carcassonne they brought. They have to find out where it's gone.&#10;&#10;Each of five players is assigned one character and six clue cards which are specific to the character. No player is allowed to look at the face of clue cards at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, players may reveal any clue cards upon all players' agreement. Based on the clues revealed, players discuss the situation and determine their answer.&#10;&#10;The game ends when 30 minutes has passed. They reveal the answer card and check if their answer was correct. If correct, they win the game and they are awarded a detective title depending on how few clue cards they revealed. &#10;user summary&#10;&#10;",

(Meishi Janken-deai ni kansha) means 'Business Card Janken - thanks for meeting!'. Deai ni kansha! is a shady phrase, which would translate to &quot;Let's be thankful for us getting to know each other!&quot;, suggesting the satirical nature of the game. Janken is the Japanese name for Rock Scissors Paper, and is quite popular in Japan as a way of deciding things. For example, a group of several players will use it quickly to choose the start player. In this game, it means more like a way of proving your claim.&#10;&#10;In Japan, business culture is very strict, and each salaryman has their own business card. It becomes more than a contact, it becomes a symbol, the soul of the businessman. There is a polite way to give and receive a business card. It's claimed a person might get fired for bending a card they've been handed. So the designers intentionally mock the sacred nature of business cards with this frivolous game.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a deck of fake but highly realistic business cards (two are real). (So realistic, I walked off with one by mistake at the Tokyo Game Market, thinking it was the publisher's card). With company logos styled like Yapoo!, NYSO, Fugitsu, Noodle, the cards have names, addresses, QR codes, the lot.&#10;&#10;Meishi Janken - Deai ni Kansha! is a game to group together more people (by their business cards) by announcing what they have in common. The game takes place at an inter-industry exchange meeting. The players each start with a hand of 4 to 6 business cards, depending on the number of players, and try to group them with other cards as potential business partners according to what the owners of the business cards might have in common. In playing the game, cards are placed face-up, and players identify common features between cards. The colours, the logos, the names of people, the addresses, any information that matches can count.&#10;&#10;Each time you add a card to a group, state what feature the new card (that is, the person) shares with the group in addition to the features already shared among the group (so as to &quot;deepen the ties&quot;), and that group will belong to you. Otherwise, replace a card in your hand by discarding it in the party area and drawing a card from the deck. You can also choose to add the cards in the party area to any group. The game ends when the deck runs out and the players have    used up their cards. At the end of the game, the player who has grouped the most cards wins as the &quot;networking master&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for humour and satire, but the publishers remind you to be respectful of people's private information, since you can use real business cards too.&#10;&#10;",

(Cards discarded are shuffled and redistributed so that players have the same number of cards in hand.)&#10;&#10;Some powers allow a player to choose the trump suit, for instance.  Another power gives a player the Joker, the highest card in the game, which they can play regardless of if they could have followed suit.  Yet another power allows that player to never need to follow suit. There is another power that if a player can reveal a hand of cards that all share a suit, that suit immediately becomes trump.&#10;&#10;Tricks are not worth any points, but collecting certain ranks is.  The player with the most points at the end of a hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",
